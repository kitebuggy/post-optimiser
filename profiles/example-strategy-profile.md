## Company / Personal Brand

**Brand name:** SecureForward Consulting

**What you do (one sentence):** We help mid-market organisations build
practical cybersecurity programmes that balance protection with
business agility.

**Your positioning in the market:** Unlike the big consultancies that
deliver 200-page reports and disappear, we stay embedded with clients
through implementation. Our differentiator is translating complex
security requirements into language that boards and business leaders
actually act on.

---

## Target Audience

**Primary personas (list 2-4):**

- CISOs in financial services and healthcare - concerned about
  regulatory compliance and board reporting
- IT Directors in organisations with 200-2,000 employees - stretched
  thin, wearing multiple hats, need practical not theoretical
- CFOs and COOs - increasingly responsible for cyber risk but lack
  technical background

**Organisation size:** 200-5,000 employees

**Geography:** UK and Ireland

**What keeps them up at night:** Regulatory pressure increasing faster
than budgets. Shadow IT proliferating. Board asking questions they
can't answer confidently. Vendor fatigue from being sold tools they
don't need.

**What they're sceptical of:** Fear-based selling ("you WILL be
breached"), generic maturity assessments, consultants who diagnose but
don't implement, AI hype without substance.

---

## Tone and Voice

**Overall tone:** Measured, authoritative and understated. British
business culture - show expertise through specificity rather than
claims.

**Cultural context:** UK B2B - understated authority preferred. Avoid
American-style hype, superlatives and exclamation marks. Directness is
valued but aggression is not.

**Words and phrases to avoid:** cutting-edge, world-class,
best-in-class, revolutionary, game-changing, leverage (as a verb),
synergy, holistic, robust (overused), "in today's landscape"

**Words and phrases that resonate:** practical, proportionate,
evidence-based, board-ready, risk-informed, pragmatic, measurable,
defensible

## Content Themes

**Core expertise areas:**

- Cybersecurity programme design for mid-market organisations
- Board-level cyber risk communication
- Regulatory compliance (NIS2, DORA, UK Cyber Governance Code)
- Third-party risk management
- Security culture and awareness

**Content pillars:**

- Regulatory commentary - what's changing and what it means practically
- "From the trenches" - anonymised lessons from real client engagements
- Contrarian takes - challenging accepted wisdom in the security industry
- Practical frameworks - tools and templates people can use immediately

**Topics to avoid:** Product reviews, vendor comparisons, anything
that could identify specific clients, party political commentary.

---

## Engagement Strategy

**Who are your ideal commenters?** CISOs, IT Directors, governance
professionals and other consultants in the security space. One comment
from a CISO is worth six from random connections.

**Why their comments matter:** Expert comments carry 5-7x algorithmic
weight and signal credibility to prospects who are researching us.

**Cross-engagement partners:** Two co-founders who comment on each
other's posts within the first 15 minutes. Three allied consultants
(legal, compliance, HR) who engage regularly.

---

## AI Tells and Style Rules

**Additional AI-generated content markers to flag:**

- "navigate the complex landscape of..." (double AI tell)
- "It's important to note that..." (throat-clearing)
- Any sentence starting with "Furthermore" or "Moreover"
- The word "delve"

**Formatting preferences:**

- Use plain hyphens (or en-dashes) with spaces, not em-dashes
- Avoid Oxford commas unless needed for clarity (e.g. "retention,
  compliance, and health and safety")
- No bold text scattered throughout - use it sparingly for emphasis

**Style guide reference:** Internal writing style guide (see company
knowledge base)

---

## Competitive Landscape

**Key competitors on LinkedIn:** Big Four cyber practices (polished
but generic), boutique pen-testing firms (too technical), managed
security providers (product-focused not advisory).

**How to differentiate in content:** We publish from a practitioner
perspective with specific, anonymised examples. Competitors tend to
publish thought leadership that sounds like marketing. Our edge is
specificity and candour.

---

## Success Metrics

**What does a successful post look like for you?**

- 30+ comments from people in our target personas
- 5+ DMs or connection requests from decision-makers
- Content referenced in subsequent sales conversations ("I saw your
  post about...")
- Post shared by someone we respect in the industry
