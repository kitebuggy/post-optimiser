# LinkedIn Algorithm: Early Engagement Research

## Overview

This page captures research findings on how early engagement affects
LinkedIn post distribution, drawn from analysis of 1.8M+ posts (van
der Blom Algorithm Insights 2025), 50,000+ posts (LinkIntel), 1M posts
(Socialinsider) and 621,833 posts (AuthoredUp).

## The Golden Window: First 30 Minutes

LinkIntel's analysis of 50,000+ posts found that the first 30 minutes
now influence **75% of total reach**, up from 60% in 2024. Posts where
the author responds to comments within 30 minutes receive:

- 64% more total comments
- 2.3x more views

This is the single highest-leverage intervention point after the
content itself. The algorithm uses early engagement velocity to decide
whether to push the post to a wider audience beyond the initial 2-5%
sample.

## Engagement Signal Hierarchy

LinkedIn's algorithm does not treat all engagement equally. The
weighting from highest to lowest value:

1. **Share with caption** - highest value. Someone endorsing your
   content to their own network with added context.
2. **Save** - strong signal of reference value.
3. **Repost** - similar to share but without added commentary.
4. **Long comment (15+ words)** - worth roughly 2.5x a like.
5. **Standard comment (5+ words)** - worth roughly 2x a like.
6. **Reaction** (emoji reactions beyond thumbs up).
7. **Like** - lowest value.

A single substantive 15+ word comment is worth approximately 2.5
passive likes in algorithmic terms.

## Comment Threading Multiplier

Posts that spark 3+ comment exchanges between different participants
(not just the author replying to individuals, but people replying to
each other) receive **5.2x amplification** versus comparable posts
without that discussion depth.

This is why contrarian takes and genuine questions outperform
informational posts - they create debate between readers rather than a
series of isolated reactions.

## Expert Commenter Weighting

Comments from relevant industry experts carry **5-7x more algorithmic
weight** than interactions from random connections.

One comment from a senior decision-maker in your target audience is
worth five or six from people outside the industry. The algorithm
assesses professional background alignment between the commenter and
the post topic.

## Dwell Time: The Hidden Ranking Signal

Dwell time (how long someone spends reading a post) is arguably the
algorithm's most important ranking signal because it is nearly
impossible to fake.

- Posts with 61+ seconds of dwell time average a 15.6% engagement rate
- Posts viewed under 3 seconds average just 1.2%

This is why well-structured content with visual breathing room
outperforms short hot takes in the long run. Carousels are
particularly strong, averaging 2-3 minutes of dwell time versus 15-30
seconds for text posts.

## Additional Distribution Factors

- Posts continue distribution for 2-3 weeks via LinkedIn's Suggested
  Posts feature (up from ~24 hours in 2024)
- Posting multiple times within 24 hours causes the newer post to receive less reach
- More than 3 consecutive same-format posts decrease reach by 20%+
- Minimum gap between posts should be 12 hours
- Optimal posting times for B2B: Tuesday to Thursday, 9-11 AM in your
  target audience's timezone
- Content from individual profiles receives 3x higher engagement than
  company page posts
- Recycled or duplicate content achieves 84% less reach than original content

## Format Engagement Multipliers

Research shows different post formats have measurably different
engagement levels:

| Format | Engagement Multiplier |
|--------|----------------------|
| Polls | 1.64x |
| Carousel/Document | 1.45x |
| Multi-image | Highest raw engagement (6.6%) |
| Single image | 1.18x |
| Native video | 1.10x |
| Text-only | Baseline |
