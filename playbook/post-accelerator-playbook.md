# LinkedIn Post Accelerator Playbook

## Purpose

This is a practical, step-by-step playbook for maximising the reach of
important LinkedIn posts. It translates the algorithm research into
actions you can execute on every significant post.

Not every post needs the full playbook. Use the tiered approach below
to match effort to importance.

## When to Use This

**Full playbook (all steps):** Company announcements, major thought
leadership pieces, campaign launches, posts tied to breaking news,
anything promoting a lead-generation asset.

**Light version (steps 1, 3, 5 only):** Regular thought leadership
posts, industry commentary, engagement-building content.

**Skip entirely:** Quick replies, reshares, casual observations.

## Pre-Publish (Day Before or Morning Of)

### Step 1: Run the Virality Checker

Score the post using the LinkedIn Virality Checker. Target 70+ before
publishing. Address any flagged issues, particularly weak hooks, AI
tells and service-pitch tone.

### Step 2: Brief Your Early Engagement Team

Identify 3-5 people who will engage in the first 30 minutes. Prioritise:

- A business partner, co-founder or close colleague - this is the most
  important single commenter
- 2-3 contacts who are senior professionals in your target audience's
  domain - expert comments carry 5-7x more algorithmic weight than
  random connections
- Anyone with a large, relevant network who might reshare

Send them a brief message the evening before or morning of:

> "Publishing a post about [topic] at [time] tomorrow. Would
> appreciate a genuine comment in the first 30 mins if it resonates
> with you. No pressure to agree - a counterpoint or question is just
> as valuable."

Do not ask people to "like and comment" generically. LinkedIn detects
engagement pod patterns with 97% accuracy. The comments must be
genuine and substantive.

### Step 3: Check Timing and Spacing

- Publish **Tuesday to Thursday, 9-11 AM** in your target audience's timezone
- Confirm at least **12 hours** since your last post
- Confirm you haven't published three text-only posts in a row (vary
  format to avoid the 20%+ reach penalty)
- If this is a newsjack tied to breaking news, prioritise timeliness
  over optimal day/time

## The Golden Window (First 30 Minutes)

This is the most important half hour. The algorithm decides in this
window whether to push the post to a wider audience. 75% of total
reach is determined here.

### Step 4: Be Present and Responsive

- **Clear your calendar** for 30 minutes after posting. Do not post
  and walk away.
- **Reply to every comment** that arrives, ideally within 5-10 minutes
- **Make your replies substantive** (15+ words). Don't just say
  "Thanks!" or "Great point." Add a follow-up thought, ask a question
  back or build on what they said.
- **Try to spark threads between commenters.** If Person A and Person
  B both comment, reply to Person A referencing Person B's point:
  "Interesting - @PersonB raised a similar question about [X]. Curious
  whether you've seen the same pattern." Posts with 3+ participants
  exchanging views receive 5.2x amplification.

### Step 5: Colleague Cross-Engagement

If you have a business partner or close colleague, the one who didn't
write the post should:

- Leave a **genuine, substantive comment (15+ words)** within the
  first 15 minutes
- The comment should add a perspective, share a related experience or
  pose a thoughtful follow-up question
- **Do not** leave a "Great post!" comment. This signals
  inauthenticity and adds no algorithmic value.
- If others comment, engage with their comments too - this creates the
  threading multiplier

Good cross-engagement comment examples:

> "This connects to something I've been seeing in conversations with
> [sector] organisations - they know they have a [problem] but don't
> know how to surface it without creating a blame culture. The
> [approach] changes that dynamic completely."
> "Worth adding that the [trend] is accelerating faster than most
> people realise. We had three conversations last month where [topic]
> was a new section on the [process]. Twelve months ago it wasn't
> mentioned."

## Post-Publish (Hours 1-24)

### Step 6: Continue Engaging

- Check back at **lunchtime (12-2 PM)** and **early evening** for new
  comments
- Continue replying substantively to every comment
- If the post is performing well (high comment count, shares),
  consider sharing it to a company page with added context

### Step 7: Capture and Learn

- After 48 hours, note the post's performance (impressions, engagement
  rate, comment count)
- Compare against previous posts - what worked differently?
- Feed learnings back into future content planning
- If the post performed exceptionally well, consider repurposing the
  topic into a carousel, newsletter article or blog post (but wait at
  least 2 weeks - recycled content within that window receives 84%
  less reach)

## Quick Reference: Comment Value Hierarchy

When deciding where to spend your engagement time, focus on the
highest-value actions:

| Action | Algorithmic Value |
|--------|------------------|
| Sparking a 3+ person comment thread | 5.2x amplification |
| Comment from a senior industry figure | 5-7x a random connection's comment |
| Long comment (15+ words) | 2.5x a like |
| Standard comment (5+ words) | 2x a like |
| Save | High (reference value signal) |
| Like | Baseline (lowest value) |

One genuine comment thread between three industry-relevant people is
worth more than 30 likes.

## What Not to Do

- **Don't use engagement pods.** LinkedIn detects them with 97%
  accuracy. Accounts caught in pods experience shadowbans with reach
  dropping from thousands to hundreds overnight.
- **Don't ask for generic engagement.** "Please like and share"
  triggers engagement bait detection.
- **Don't post and disappear.** An unanswered comment in the first 30
  minutes is a wasted opportunity. Each reply you leave also counts as
  fresh engagement on the post.
- **Don't edit the post after publishing.** Edits reset the
  distribution clock and can reduce reach significantly.
- **Don't delete and repost.** LinkedIn's algorithm remembers deleted
  content and may penalise the repost.
